## Overview
This repository demonstrates the steps required to take a pre-trained **YOLOv10** model and convert it to TensorFlow Lite format. The process allows you to deploy the model efficiently on edge devices like smartphones, Raspberry Pi, microcontrollers, and more. We focus on making the inference process faster and more reliable while maintaining model accuracy.

## Why TensorFlow Lite?
**TensorFlow Lite (TFLite)** is an open-source deep learning framework specifically designed for running machine learning models on mobile and edge devices. By exporting your YOLOv10 model to TFLite format, you can optimize your model for low-latency, real-time inference on devices with limited computational resources.

## Key Features
- **On-device Optimization**: Reduces inference latency and increases performance by processing data locally.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on a variety of devices, including Android, iOS, Linux-based embedded systems, and microcontrollers.
- **Diverse Language Support**: Compatible with Java, Swift, Objective-C, Python, and C++.
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Supports accelerators such as Coral Edge TPU for improved performance.

## Installation

Before exporting the YOLOv10 model to TFLite format, you need to install the required dependencies.

1. Install the **Ultralytics** YOLO package:

   ```bash
   pip install ultralytics
